List of plugins to Jenkins 1.535:
git 	2.0
ssh credentials
ssh agent
git client
scp api

*Note:
did this on the mac 10.8.5.
I couldn't get the following  to work:
- RPM - installed with macport, but it's not know by shell invoked by jenkins
- Git - don't know why but Jenkins couldn't connect to https://github.com Gave up
- many jjb targets, including scm: maven: publish: didn't work, had no effect
Also, python's white space is a real pain. Spent much time indenting to get past teh python
interpreter. Reminded me of some buggy Makefiles.


I should set-up VirtualBox or some other hypervisor on my mac, just a bit short on time.
So I have only one job instead of three, but id does what was asked except:
- no jobs are spawned on git ci (think I have the right trigger, but Git plugin wasn't working)
